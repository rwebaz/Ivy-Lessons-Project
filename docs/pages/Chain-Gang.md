## CVMs

> **Hint**. {{ page.hint }}

The **Chain Virtual Machine** aka the **CVM** drives the Turing complete **Chain**  platform developed by the **Chain Gang** at [Chain dot com](2).

The same restriction applies to runaway contracts when using the **CVM** as when using the **Ethereum Virtual Machine**, or **EVM**.

### Free Gas

However, unlike the **Ethereum** platform, the *gas* is free when using the **Chain dot com** platform.

## Receiver Objects

A **Receiver Object** is a node that issues a digital form of invoice to an *incoming party*.

The *incoming party* resides externally to the **Receiver Object** on the network and is sending a message to the **Receiver Object** to please accept coin.

The message being read by the *receiving party* is an attempt to engage one or more methods that are located on the **Receiver Object**.

The overture to accept coin from the *incoming party* needs to be acknowledged by the *receiving party* before a transaction can take place.

In other words, an external party to a contract cannot simply toss a coin at another node on the network without an acknowledgment from the *receiving party*.

A protocol must be established to either accept the incoming asset if desirable, or to reject the incoming asset if by some other method the sender is deemed not worthy.

### Serialize and Send

First, we have to create a **Receiver Object** with the keyword "Receiver", as follows:

```liquid
{% raw %}
Receiver robin = new Account.ReceiverBuilder()
{% endraw %}
```

Here, we have initialized our **Receiver Object** with the name `robin`and we have assigned the value of the return from the new Account ReceiverBuilder method to our new `robin` **Receiver Object**.

### Fleshing It Out

The authors at the **Chain Gang** have let the end-user sink or swim with the balance of the code, at this juncture.

```liquid
{% raw %}
Receiver robin = new Account.ReceiverBuilder()
  .setAccountAlias("castle")
{% endraw %}
```

And, further ...

```liquid
{% raw %}
Receiver robin = new Account.ReceiverBuilder()
  .setAccountAlias("castle")
  .create(client);
{% endraw %}
```

And, more ...

```liquid
{% raw %}
Receiver robin = new Account.ReceiverBuilder()
  .setAccountAlias("castle")
  .create(client);

String castleReceiverSerialized = castleReceiver.to_Json();
{% endraw %}
```

More code ...

```liquid
{% raw %}
Receiver robin = new Account.ReceiverBuilder()
  .setAccountAlias("castle")
  .create(client);

String castleReceiverSerialized = castleReceiver.to_Json();
  castle_receiver = chain.accounts.create_receiver
    account_alias: 'castle'
  )
{% endraw %}
```

Still more ...

```liquid
{% raw %}
Receiver robin = new Account.ReceiverBuilder()
  .setAccountAlias("castle")
  .create(client);

String castleReceiverSerialized = castleReceiver.to_Json();
  castle_receiver = chain.accounts.create_receiver
    account_alias: 'castle'
  )

 castle_receiver_serialized = bob_receiver.to_json
{% endraw %}
```

Keep it coming, line by line, method by method ...

```liquid
{% raw %}
Receiver robin = new Account.ReceiverBuilder()
  .setAccountAlias("castle")
  .create(client);

String castleReceiverSerialized = castleReceiver.to_Json();

  castle_receiver = chain.accounts.create_receiver(
    account_alias: 'castle'
  )

  castle_receiver_serialized = bob_receiver.to_json

  const castleReceiverSerializedPromise = client.accounts.createReceiver(
    {
      accountAlias: 'castle',
    }
  ).then(castleReceiver => {
      return JSON.stringify(castleReceiver)
    }
  )
{% endraw %}
```

## Receiver Requests

A **Receiver Request** is the message to the **Receiver Object** to please accept coin.

### Creation

```liquid
{% raw %}
Transaction.Template spendingTransaction2 = new Transaction.Builder()
//
  .addAction(new Transaction.Action.SpendFromAccount()
    .setAccountAlias("mminail")
    .setAssetAlias("medcoin")
    .setAmount(1)
  ).addAction(new Transaction.Action.ControlWithReceiver()
    .setReceiver(Receiver.fromJson(castleReceiverSerialized))
    .setAssetAlias("medcoin")
    .setAmount(1)
  ).build(client);
//
{% endraw %}
```

### Submission

Notice how the **Receiver Request** above includes a call to the pre-made 'castleReceiverSerialized' method.
